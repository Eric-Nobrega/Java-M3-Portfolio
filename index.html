    <h1 class="lead pb-3">Above is a short video of my game City Secret Agent. It is a game in which the user is
      placed in several different
      scenarios, such as a City Setting, Space Setting, Underwater, etc. The goal is to complete the game as fast as
      possbile, while
      eliminating all the enemies present on the map. There are several features that I am proud of, most namely the
      multiple saving,
      enemy patroling, custom pickup objects, etc.

    <h1 class="lead">
      During the development of the game, I initially struggled with managing a project of this size, as there are
      several different classes, some inheriting from others. However, I feel as if now I am more than comfortable
      with this topic, aswell as other Object Oriented Programming as a whole. In summary, the development process
      of this game/project has helped to further my knowledge of Java, as well as other programming concepts.
